# n_stepTD_opt_n
Title: n-Step Temporal Difference Learning with Optimal n.

(A)"n_step_TD_SDPSA" contains code for the experiment of the proposed algorithm.
Step 1: Install required python packages such as numpy and matplotlib.
Step 2: For Experiment #1, #2, #3 run .py file in the folder "n_step_TD_SDPSA\n_step_TD_pt2". For Experiment #4, #5, #6 run .py file in the folder "n_step_TD_SDPSA\n_step_TD_pt4". For Experiment #7, #8, #9 run .py file in the folder "n_step_TD_SDPSA\n_step_TD_pt6". For each experiment need to place corresponding input paramentes in the python file.
Step 3: Use n_step_TD_plot.py to plot the experimental results.

(B)"n_step_TD_without_SDPSA_different_n" contains code to observe converged error of n-step TD algorithm for a fixed learning rate and different values of given "n".
